# Covid-19 Sentiment Analysis Dashboard 

This is a Covid-19 Dashboard Created to analyse the sentiment regarding different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. For this project, I have chosen COVID-19 Vaccination, COVID-19 Restriction, and COVID-19 in General as the topics to analyse. The data used in this project was collected from Twitter using Tweepy which a Python library that helps to interact with Twitter API. The sentiment prediction on the data collected was done using the Recurrent Neural Network model (RNN),andt he RNN model was created based on LSTM architecture.
